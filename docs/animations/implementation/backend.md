- **LightHandler**: Controls lighting adjustments and animations
- **MaterialHandler**: Handles material updates and properties
- **ObjectHandler**: Manages object transformations and constraints
- **AssetHandler**: New handler for asset placement operations

### Session Management

- Improved session tracking with state management
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Resource cleanup on session end

## Template System

The template system has been refactored to support:

- Modular template components
- Better validation and error handling
- Improved API endpoints for template management
- Support for camera, light, and product animations

## Asset Placement

New asset placement system features:

- Precise positioning controls
- Rotation and scaling operations
- Undo/redo support
- Real-time synchronization with Blender
